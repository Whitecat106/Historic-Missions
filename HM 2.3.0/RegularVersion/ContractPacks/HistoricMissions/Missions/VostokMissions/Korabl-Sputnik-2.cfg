    description = Korabl-Sputnik 2 (Russian: Ship-Satellite 2), also known as Vostok-1K No.2 and incorrectly as Sputnik 5 in the West, was a Soviet artificial satellite, and the third test flight of the Vostok spacecraft. It was the first spaceflight to send animals into orbit and return them safely back to Earth. Launched on August 19, 1960, it paved the way for the first human orbital flight, Vostok 1, which was launched less than eight months later.
