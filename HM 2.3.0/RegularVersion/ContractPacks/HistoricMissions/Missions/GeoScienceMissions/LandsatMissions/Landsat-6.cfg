    synopsis = Launch Landsat-6
    description = Landsat 6, equipped with upgraded versions of the instruments on its predecessor, was designed to continue the Landsat program. It was launched on October 5, 1993 using a Titan II launch vehicle, but failed to reach orbit. As a consequence, Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 were used well beyond their designed lifespan. Landsat 6 omitted the Multi-Spectral Scanner found on its predecessors, but carried an Enhanced Thematic Mapper, which improved on the previous Thematic Mapper by adding a 15m-resolution panchromatic band.
