	description = Soyuz 11 (Russian: Union 11) was the only manned mission to board the world's first space station, Salyut 1 (Soyuz 10 had soft-docked but had not been able to enter due to latching issues). The mission arrived at the space station on 7 June 1971 and departed on 30 June. The mission ended in disaster when the crew capsule depressurised during preparations for reentry, killing the three-man crew. The Soyuz 11 crew members were Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev.
	notes = Memorial Mission to honour Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev; the only humans to have died outside of Earths atmosphere.
