    description = Bion 6 (Cosmos 1514) was a biomedical spaceflight research mission that was launched on December 12, 1983. Two Rhesus monkeys were flown into orbit implanted with sensors to permit monitoring of carotid artery blood flow. Eighteen pregnant white rats were used for studies of the effects of microgravity and radiation. The rats subsequently produced normal litters. The mission ended after five days.
