    description = The Soviet R-2 ballistic missile was developed in 1947-1953, nearly in parallel with the R-1 from which it derived. Versions of the R-2 for suborbital manned flight were studied by Sergei Korolev in 1956-1958, but it was decided instead to move directly to orbital flights of the Vostok. However some equipment tested on the R-2 found its way onto canine flights of Sputnik and Vostok. This was the main R-2 variant for scientific work, used to continue the experiment series of the R-1 to a height of 200 kilometers. Instruments were carried to study the atmosphere over 150 km; ultra-violet observation of the sun; ultra-violet astronomy; the ionosphere; and recovery of biological payloads (dogs and rabbits) from double the altitude of the R-1.
