Select an Era in history you wish to play or play with the full pack. 

- Space Race Era: V-2 tests to Soyuz-Apollo (Includes Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Early Soyuz & Salyut & Various Probe Missions)

- Space Exploration Era: Shuttle tests to STS-95 (Includes various Soyuz, Shuttle flights, Mir missions and interplanetary probes)

- Space Science Era: Initial ISS assembly to modern space missions (Includes rovers, probes, Soyuz missions, STS-95 - 135 and future content!) 

- Full Pack: Play through the Megladonic series of 700 contracts! 

* Note: I would not reccomend switching from a subpack (Space Race, Exploration or Science) to the Full pack as this may break progress).

Once one era is complete you may uninstall that era and install the next, or keep both installed! 

Any issues please contact me (Whitecat106) via the Forum Thread!

Enjoy!
