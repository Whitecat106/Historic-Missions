	description = The Aggregate 3 (A-3) was the third in a series of ballistic missiles designed and developed by Wernher von Braun in 1937 under the leadership of Dr. Walter Robert Dornberger, at Kummersdorf south of Berlin.
	
	The missile was 6.74m long by 0.68m in diameter and had a takeoff weight of 748 kg. The A-3 also incorporated a three gyroscope system to control the missile during flight, and had a parachute installed to facilitate recovery.
	
	The first of the Aggregate rockets to be launched from the Peenem√ºnde area, the initial A3 was sent off on December 4, 1937 as part of Operation Lighthouse. The first and second launches displayed problems with both premature parachute deployment and engine failure; both crashed close to their takeoff points. The parachute was disabled in the third and fourth rockets, but these, too, experienced engine failures, though the lack of parachute drag allowed them to crash further from the launch site.

	According to another source, one A3 reached a maximum downrange of 12km (7.5mi) and maximum altitude of 18km (11mi).
