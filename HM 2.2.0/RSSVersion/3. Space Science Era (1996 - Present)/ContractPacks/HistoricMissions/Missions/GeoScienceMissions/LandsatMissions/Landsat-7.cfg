    synopsis = Launch Landsat-7
    description = Landsat 7, launched on April 15, 1999, is the seventh satellite of the Landsat program. Landsat 7's primary goal is to refresh the global archive of satellite photos, providing up-to-date and cloud-free images. The Landsat Program is managed and operated by the USGS, and data from Landsat 7 is collected and distributed by the USGS. The NASA World Wind project allows 3D images from Landsat 7 and other sources to be freely navigated and viewed from any angle. The satellite's companion, Earth Observing-1, trails by one minute and follows the same orbital characteristics. Landsat 7 was built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company.
