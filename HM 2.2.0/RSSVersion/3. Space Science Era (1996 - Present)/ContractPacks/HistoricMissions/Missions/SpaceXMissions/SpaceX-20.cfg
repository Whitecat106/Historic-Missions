    description = Falcon 9 Flight 20 (also known as Orbcomm OG2 M2) was a Falcon 9 space launch that occurred on 22 December 2015 at 01:29 UTC (21 December, 8:29 pm local time). It was the first time that the first stage of an orbital rocket made a successful return and vertical landing. The successful landing of the first stage at Landing Zone 1, near the launch site, was the end result of a five-year technology development program funded by SpaceX and came on a flight test that followed the primary launch mission. Following separation of the second stage, SpaceX conducted the eighth of its controlled booster descent tests of the spent first stage, the first in which the descent target location was on land, and also the first ever successful landing. Prior to this flight, SpaceX's two previous attempts at a vertical landing and booster recovery ended in failure to recover the rocket. The success of Flight 20 marked a significant milestone en route to the company’s goal of creating a reusable rocket system that would significantly reduce the cost of launching payloads into orbit.
