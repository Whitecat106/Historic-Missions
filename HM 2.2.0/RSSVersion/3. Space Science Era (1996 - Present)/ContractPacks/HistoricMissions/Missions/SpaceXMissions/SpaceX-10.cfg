    description = Second Falcon 9 booster with landing legs. Following second-stage separation, SpaceX conducted a controlled-descent test of the discarded booster vehicle. The first stage successfully decelerated from hypersonic velocity in the upper atmosphere, made reentry and landing burns, deployed its landing legs and touched down on the ocean surface. As with the previous mission, the first stage then tipped over as intended and was not recovered.
