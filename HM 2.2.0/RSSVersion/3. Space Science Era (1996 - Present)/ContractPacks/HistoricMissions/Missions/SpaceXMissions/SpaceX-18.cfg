    description = The initial launch date of TurkmenAlem52E/MonacoSAT was planned to be March 21, 2015. The original launch date was delayed to study a problem with a helium pressurization system on the Falcon 9 rocket. A new launch date was set for no earlier than 24 April 2015. Despite the impending launch of TurkmenAlem52E/MonacoSAT in April 2015, the Turkmen government banned all satellite dishes in Turkmenistan, also in April 2015. The statement issued by the government indicated that all existing satellite dishes would have to be removed or destroyed, in an effort by the government to fully block access of the population to many "hundreds of independent international media outlets which are currently accessible in the country only through satellite dishes, including all leading international news channels in different languages. The main target of this campaign is Azatlyk Radiosy, the Turkmen-language service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. It is the only independent source of information about Turkmenistan and the world in the Turkmen language and is widely listened to in the country."
