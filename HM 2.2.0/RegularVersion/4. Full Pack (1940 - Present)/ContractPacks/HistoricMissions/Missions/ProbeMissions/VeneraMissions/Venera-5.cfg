    description = Venera 5 (Russian: meaning Venus 5) (manufacturer's designation: 2V (V-69)) was a probe in the Soviet space program Venera for the exploration of Venus. Venera 5 was launched towards Venus to obtain atmospheric data. The spacecraft was very similar to Venera 4 although it was of a stronger design. The launch was conducted using a Molniya-M rocket, flying from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. When the atmosphere of Venus was approached, a capsule weighing 405 kg and containing scientific instruments was jettisoned from the main spacecraft. During satellite descent towards the surface of Venus, a parachute opened to slow the rate of descent. For 53 minutes on May 16, 1969, while the capsule was suspended from the parachute, data from the Venusian atmosphere were returned.[1] It landed at 3°S 18°E. The spacecraft also carried a medallion bearing the State Coat of Arms of the USSR and a bas-relief of V. I. Lenin to the night side of Venus.
