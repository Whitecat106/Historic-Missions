    description = Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977, to study the outer Solar System. Operating for 37 years, 8 months and 21 days the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and return data. At a distance of about 130.62 AU (1.954×10^10 km), it is the farthest spacecraft from Earth. The primary mission ended on November 20, 1980, after Voyager passed through the Jovian system in 1979 and the Saturnian system in 1980. It was the first probe to provide detailed images of the two planets and their moons. It also studied the weather, magnetic fields, and rings of those planets and used the gravity asset of them to achieve velocity.
