    description = The Mars 2 was an unmanned space probe of the Mars program, a series of unmanned Mars landers and orbiters launched by the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. The Mars 2 and Mars 3 missions consisted of identical spacecraft, each with an orbiter and an attached lander. The orbiter is identical to the Venera 9 bus or orbiter. They were launched by a Proton-K heavy launch vehicle with a Blok D upper stage. The lander of Mars 2 became the first man-made object to reach the surface of Mars. On May 19, 1971, the Proton-K-2 blasted from Baikonur Cosmodrome. After the first stage separated the second stage started. The third stage engine blasted Mars 2 into parking orbit then the Blok-D sent Mars 2 to Mars, where the descent module was deployed before Mars-2 put itself into Mars orbit.
	
	The descent module separated from the orbiter on 27 November 1971 about 4.5 hours before reaching Mars. After entering the atmosphere at approximately 6 km/s, the descent system on the module malfunctioned, possibly because the angle of entry was too steep. The descent sequence did not operate as planned and the parachute did not deploy. The descent module became the first man-made object to impact the surface of Mars. The exact crash site is unknown, but it is estimated to be at 45°S 313°W. Attempts to contact the probe after the crash were unsuccessful.
