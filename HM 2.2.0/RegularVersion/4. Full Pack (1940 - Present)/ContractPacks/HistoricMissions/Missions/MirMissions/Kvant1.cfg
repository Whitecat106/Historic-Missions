    notes = Its time to launch the next Mir Module
    description = On 30 March 1987, the module Kvant-1 was launched; it was the second module of the space station Mir, and would add 40 m3 of pressurized volume to Mir, bringing the total to about 130 m3. Attached to Kvant-1 was a Functional Service Module (FSM), which contained propellants, and was used to direct the module to Mir. At launch, the Kvant module had a mass of 11 tonnes, and the FSM had a mass of 9.6 tonnes. At the time, this was the heaviest payload to be launched by a Proton rocket. The automatic docking system was unable to dock the module completely with Mir on the first attempt.
