    description = Salyut 7 was unmanned after the undocking of Soyuz T-11 in October 1984 until Soyuz T-13 docked with the station in June 1985. Salyut 7 developed problems during the unmanned time, which meant that the crew of Soyuz T-13 had to perform a manual docking and do repairs to the station.
