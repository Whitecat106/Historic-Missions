    description = Korabl-Sputnik 1 (Russian: Ship Satellite 1), (also known as Sputnik 4 in the West) was the first test flight of the Soviet Vostok programme, and the first Vostok spacecraft. It was launched on May 15, 1960. Though Korabl-Sputnik 1 was unmanned, it was a precursor to the first human spaceflight, Vostok 1. A bug in the guidance system had pointed the capsule in the wrong direction, so instead of dropping into the atmosphere the satellite moved into a higher orbit. The descent module eventually re-entered the atmosphere on September 1, 1962. A piece was found in the middle of North 8th Street in Manitowoc, Wisconsin in the northern United States.
