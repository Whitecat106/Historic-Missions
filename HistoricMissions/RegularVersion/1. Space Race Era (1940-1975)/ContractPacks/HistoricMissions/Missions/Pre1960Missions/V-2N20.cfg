    synopsis = Perform the 20th test launch of a US V-2 rocket, and recover its scientific payload intact
    description = The first animals sent into space were fruit flies aboard a U.S. launched V-2 rocket named Blossom-1 on 20 February 1947 from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The purpose of the experiment was to explore the effects of radiation exposure at high altitudes. The rocket reached 68 miles (109 km) in 3 minutes and 10 seconds, past both the U.S. Air Force 50-mile and the international 100 km definitions of the boundary of space. The 'Blossom' capsule was ejected and successfully deployed its parachute. The fruit flies were recovered alive. Other V2 missions carried biological samples, including moss.
