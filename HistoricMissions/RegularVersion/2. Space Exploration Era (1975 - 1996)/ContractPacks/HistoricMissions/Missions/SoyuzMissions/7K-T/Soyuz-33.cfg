    description = Soyuz 33 (Russian: Union 33) was a 1979 Soviet manned space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the ninth mission to the orbiting facility, but an engine failure forced the mission to be aborted, and the crew had to return to earth before docking with the station. It was the first-ever failure of a Soyuz engine during orbital operations.
