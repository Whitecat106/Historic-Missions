    synopsis = Perform a test flight of the Buran Shuttle.
    description = The Buran spacecraft, GRAU index 11F35 K1 was a Soviet orbital vehicle analogous in function and design to the US Space Shuttle, developed by Chief Designer Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy of RKK Energia. Buran completed one unmanned spaceflight in 1988 and remains the only Soviet reusable spacecraft to be launched into space; the Buran programme was cancelled in 1993 following the dissolution of the USSR. It was treated as a Soviet space shuttle but only the plane itself was theoretically reusable, and while it was recovered successfully after its first orbital flight it was never reused. The expendable Energia rocket served as its launch vehicle. The only Buran to actually fly in space was destroyed in 2002 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, when the hangar it was stored in collapsed.
