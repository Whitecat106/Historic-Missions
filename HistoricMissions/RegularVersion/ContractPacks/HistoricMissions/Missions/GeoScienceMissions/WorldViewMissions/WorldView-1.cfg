    description = WorldView-1 is a commercial earth observation satellite owned by DigitalGlobe. It was launched September 18, 2007, followed later by the WorldView-2 in 2009. First imagery from WorldView-1 was available in October 2007, prior to the six-year anniversary of the launch of QuickBird, DigitalGlobe’s previous satellite. WorldView-1 was partially financed through an agreement with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Some of the imagery captured by WorldView-1 for the NGA is not available to the general public. However, WorldView-1 freed capacity on DigitalGlobe’s QuickBird satellite to meet the growing commercial demand for multi-spectral geospatial imagery.
