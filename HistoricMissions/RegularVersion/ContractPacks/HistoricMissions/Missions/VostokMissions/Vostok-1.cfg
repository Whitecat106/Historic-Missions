    description = Vostok 1 (Russian: East 1 or Orient 1) was the first spaceflight of the Vostok programme and the first human spaceflight in history. The Vostok 3KA space capsule was launched on April 12, 1961 from Baikonur Cosmodrome with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, making him the first human to cross into outer space. The spaceflight consisted of one orbit around Earth, the shortest manned orbital flight to date. According to official records, the spaceflight took 108 minutes from launch to landing. As planned, Gagarin parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at 7 km (23,000 ft) altitude. Due to the secrecy surrounding the Soviet space programme at the time, many details of the spaceflight only came to light years later, and several details in the original press releases turned out to be false.
