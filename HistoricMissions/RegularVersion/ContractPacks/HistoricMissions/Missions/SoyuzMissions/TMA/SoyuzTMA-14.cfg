    description = The Soyuz TMA-14 (Russian: Union TMA-14) was a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, which launched on 26 March 2009. It transported two members of the Expedition 19 crew as well as spaceflight participant Charles Simonyi on his second self-funded flight to the space station. TMA-14 was the 101st manned flight of a Soyuz spacecraft, including launch failures; however, it was the 100th to launch and land manned, as Soyuz 34 was launched unmanned to replace Soyuz 32, which landed empty.
