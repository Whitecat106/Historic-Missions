	description = STS-61-B was NASA's 23rd Space Shuttle mission, and its second using Space Shuttle Atlantis. The shuttle was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 26 November 1985. During STS-61-B, the shuttle crew deployed three communications satellites, and tested techniques of constructing structures in orbit. Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 16:33 EST on 3 December 1985, after 6 days and 21 hours in orbit. STS-61-B marked the quickest turnaround of a Shuttle orbiter from launch to launch in history � just 54 days elapsed between Atlantis' launch on STS-51-J and launch on STS-61-B. The mission was also notable for carrying the first and until today only Mexican astronaut, Rodolfo Neri Vela.
