    description = Voyager 2 is a 722 kg (1,592 lb) space probe launched by NASA on August 20, 1977 to study the outer Solar System and eventually interstellar space. It was actually launched before Voyager 1, but Voyager 1 moved faster and eventually passed it. Voyager 2 has been operating for 37 years, 9 months and 7 days as of 27 May 2015, and the Deep Space Network is still receiving its data transmissions.
