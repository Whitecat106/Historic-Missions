    description = Ulysses is a decommissioned robotic space probe whose primary mission was to orbit the Sun and study it at all latitudes. It was launched in 1990, made three "fast latitude scans" of the Sun in 1994/1995, 2000/2001, and 2007/2008. In addition several comets were studied by the probe. The space probe was a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). The last day for mission operations on Ulysses was June 30, 2009.
