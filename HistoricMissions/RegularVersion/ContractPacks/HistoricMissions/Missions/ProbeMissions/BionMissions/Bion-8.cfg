    description = Bion 8 (Cosmos 1887) was a Bion satellite. It carried scientific instruments for continuing research into the effects of spaceflight on monkeys and other biological objects, radiation safety, and physics. Research and experiments were also carried out, within the framework of international cooperation, on the study and use of space for peaceful purposes. Taking part in the experiment were scientists from the Hungarian People's Republic, German Democratic Republic, Polish People's Republic, Romanian Socialist Republic, Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, United States, France, and European Space Agency. The mission ended after 13 days.
